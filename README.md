# 👋 Hi, I’m Derican

## 🎓 Researcher–builder at the intersection of learning sciences and AI

I study student modeling and simulation, with a focus on how heterogeneous educational data — dialogue, behavioral logs, questionnaires, and classroom interactions — can be integrated to represent learner characteristics and developmental trajectories.

## 🧠 Research interests

LLM-based student agents & agent-based modeling

Individual-level behavior simulation

Learning processes reflected in dialogue and interaction data

Interpretability and theoretical alignment in AI systems

Epistemic boundaries of generative models in education

## 🔬 My perspective
Rather than treating AI as a black-box predictor, I focus on what can — and cannot — be meaningfully simulated at the level of individual learners.
My work explores the tension between observable behavior, latent constructs, and language-based representations of cognition.
Reach my work through [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09183)!

## 🛠️ Also a system builder
Alongside research, I design and implement full-stack educational systems, including asynchronous task orchestration, progress tracking, and real-time feedback pipelines — examining how technical architecture and theoretical assumptions co-evolve in AI-supported learning environments. Checkout [Feedforward System](https://ffs.maic.chat) and several [tools](https://pypi.org/user/derican/) on PyPI!

## 🌱 Beyond research

When I’m not working on models or systems, I enjoy:

🏀 Basketball, badminton or swimming

📱 Clash Royale

💻 The Binding of Isaac, Mahjong Soul
